# Grafana-Dashboard-JW 

A cool Grafana dashboard for straight-forward pod workload and K8s cluster hardware overview.
Metrics include but not limited to: pod-namespace distribution overview, pod-node distribution overview, node CPU, node DRAM, node storage, node networking, persistent volumes (and persistent volume claims), and a detailed namespace-node-pod table.
